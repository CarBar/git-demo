# Git Demo README

## Commands

### git init

Create a new repository in the current directory. This is only done once per repository and is not needed when contributing to an established repository.

### git clone

Make a local copy of a remote repository to work with it. A repository is only needed to be cloned one time.

### git branch

The `git branch` command can be used to view branches that exist in a repository. The `-a` switch will allow you to view both remote and local branches. This command can also be used to create and delete branches as desired. Though creating branches is simple to do with [checkout](#git-checkout).

### git status

Check the status of your git repository. This provides information about current branch, content changes both staged and not.
